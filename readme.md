## Overview of JavaScript ##

### JavaScript ###

- JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development.
- It is a client side scripting language that runs in the browser, allowing developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages.
- JavaScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development, making it a versatile language.
- It is an event-driven language, meaning it can respond to user actions such as clicks, form submissions, and other events.
- It can also be used to create games, animations and other interactive elements on web pages.

### JavaScript Basics ###
- JavaScript uses variables to store data values.
- Variables can be declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.
- JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it.
- Common data types in JavaScript include strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.
- JavaScript is case-sensitive, meaning that `myVariable` and `myvariable` are considered different variables.

### JavaScript in HTML ###
- JavaScript can be embedded directly into HTML using the `<script>` tag.
- The `<script>` tag can be placed in the `<head>` or `<body>` section of an HTML document.
